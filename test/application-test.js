//data vertex client - dapp aggregator - database - data vertex client


//benchmarking

//database
//number of txs per second, tables, how does cache do
//range queries
//compression
//table deletion
//synchronization + updates
//0chain updates
//start-up costs
//using another database folder

//data vertex complete
//start-up
//minimum requirements (cpu, memory)
//how these requirements scale
//speed of transactions

//operating many with: (scaling) (how is this done) (nginx)
  //same database
  //differnt database

//dapp aggregator (functions specifically)
  //transactions, events, etc
  //how fast can they be done, do they backup, are there errors
  //can the aggregator handle transaction errors

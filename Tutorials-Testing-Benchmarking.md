# Testing and Benchmarking in Proxima
Proxima is designed around transparency and automation. We can test and benchmark components within the network once they are generated. Let's explore what we can do to ensure that our data vertex will work and remain working.

- Data vertex
- Database
- Data Aggregator
- Proxima SDK

## Installation and Setup

Before we can begin, we have to make sure that we have installed all of the dependencies required. Check the list below to see what is needed!

#### Requirements

- npm/yarn
- docker
- docker-compose
- go

#### Installing Proxima CLI
An additional requirement for this is the Proxima CLI. Installation of the Proxima CLI can be done through yarn. This only needs to be done once. For more information on the CLI, check out the repo.
```
yarn add -g proxima-cli
```
Once the CLI is installed, you can then check the versioning.

```
proxima -v
```
#### Getting a data vertex
For this we are going to be using a data vertex found in the repo below. Use your own data vertex, or clone ours and begin:

```
git clone
```

Let's get started!

# Connecting to a Proxima data vertex through the SDK
If you are already running a client. Since the SDK, we are currently building SDK plug-ins for the Android, iOS, and browser within the autogeneration.

## Installation and Set-up


#### Requirements


- proxima-cli


#### Installing Proxima SDK
Installation of the Proxima CLI can be done through yarn. This only needs to be done once. For more information on the CLI, check the repo.
```
yarn add proxima-sdk-js
```
Once the CLI is installed, you can then check the versioning.

```
proxima -v
```

## Using our SDK
The Proxima SDK is built on then React Native can be used for a variety of platforms implementations including: iOS, Android, browser. We are going to be looking at how to work with the SDK in javascript.

```javascript
const proxima = require('proxima-sdk-js')

//initialize proxima Client
```

In this code block, we are importing the client SDK, and then initializing the node connection. This will enable us to use data vertices with the different features of the Proxima SDK, include fraud proofs, Merkle verification, and client-side optimizations.

## Getting a data vertex

```javascript
const proxima = require('proxima-sdk-js')

//initialize proxima Client
```

- getting plug-in
- importing
- connecting and getting  

## Using the data vertex

```javascript
const proxima = require('proxima-sdk-js')

//initialize proxima Client
```
- getting plug-in
- importing

- connecting and getting  


## Extensions
For information on creating a data vertex or testing and benchmarking the vertex look at our other tutorials.
